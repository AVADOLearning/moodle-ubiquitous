# Contributing to Ubiquitous

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the project!

## Code of conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing code and documentation

The Ubiquitous project follows the [GitHub Flow workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Whilst we recommend you familiarise yourself with GitHub's documentation, the abridged version is as follows:

1. :boom: Branch off of `master`:

   ```
   $ git checkout -b my-feature master
   ```

2. :wrench: Make and commit your changes:

   ```
   $ git commit -m '<component>: <description>'
   ```

3. :arrow_up_small: Push your commits and open a pull request:

   ```
   $ git push -u origin my-feature
   ```

4. :speech_balloon: Engage in discussion around your changes, making amendments as necessary.

5. :ship: Ship it!

Good pull requests should:

1. Have a clear rationale that's consistent with the project's goals.
2. Limit themselves to a well-defined scope.
3. Use descriptive messages in commits; history provides signposting for future developers.
4. Include appropriate documentation for end users and developers alike.

### Scope changes

Changes larger in scope than bug fixes and incremental improvements should start with a discussion in a GitHub issue. This will allow us to understand the requirements and discuss options for implementation.

Note that whilst we can only merge changes we're realistically able to support, we'll be happy to help you with customisations where we're able.

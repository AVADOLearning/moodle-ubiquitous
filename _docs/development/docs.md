# Documentation

## Building

The documentation is managed with the excellent [GitBook toolchain](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/) and hosted by [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/). To work with it locally:

```
# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Launch the server --- use this when making changes
$ npm run gitbook -- serve

# Or perform a one-time build to _book/
$ npm run gitbook -- build
```
